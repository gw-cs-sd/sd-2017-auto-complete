Joe here is the instructions on how to set up Mongo if you want to do your own testing
First download all the json files and unzip them.

For this example  I will show you the import line for up1, up2, up3, and up4.
my unziped files were named up1.json.gz_exporting, don't know why they have the .gz_exporting on the end they just did


mongoimport --jsonArray --db oneGram --collection up1 --file theWholeFilePath\up1.json.gz_exporting
mongoimport --jsonArray --db twoGram --collection up2 --file theWholeFilePath\up2.json.gz_exporting
mongoimport --jsonArray --db threeGram --collection up3 --file theWholeFilePath\up3.json.gz_exporting
mongoimport --jsonArray --db fourGram --collection up4 --file theWholeFilePath\up4.json.gz_exporting

not how the db name changes, this is imporant.  You need to use these exact name and if you up the files in the wrong db, I don't know
what will happen. Did not test that
Also the first time you import something into a db, monogo will create that db, so don't worry if you have not made the dbs

After you have imported all your files, you are good to go.  I did not change any of the method names you used in the API perviously.

If you are actually testing the java code for preformance, you just need to change the parameters in the main function
