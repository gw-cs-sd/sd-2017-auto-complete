						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						I am a Computer Science students at the George Washington University.  I am 22 years old and am from Bowie, Maryland.  I will be going to work at Accenture Federal Services after college doing Technology Consaulting in Arlington, Virginia.

						<strong>Contributions:</strong>
						I worked on the java code for our project.  This involved quering data from our mongo databse and selecting what to return from all the results.  After all the quering, we had 100 potention results, after my algorithm, that drops down to at most 10 results that are then returned to the user.  To pick the 10 results, my partner and I created a weighing system,  that I implemented in my algorithm.  Potentional results were givce scores, and these scores had to meet certain thresholds to be considered use able.  I had to make sure the algorithm and queries were all done fast enough to get quick results to users.
